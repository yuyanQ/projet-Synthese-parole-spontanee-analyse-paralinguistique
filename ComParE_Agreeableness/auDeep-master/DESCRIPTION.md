**auDeep** is a Python toolkit for unsupervised feature learning with deep neural networks (DNNs). Currently, the main focus of this project is feature extraction from audio data with deep recurrent autoencoders. However, the core feature learning algorithms are not limited to audio data. Furthermore, we plan on implementing additional DNN-based feature learning approaches.

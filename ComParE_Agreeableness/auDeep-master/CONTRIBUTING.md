# Contributing Guidelines

We are more than happy to receive your contributions to auDeep! If you have improvements to auDeep, send us your pull requests. For those new to GitHub, there's a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for getting started. 

A team member will be assigned to review your pull request. After a pull request has been approved, we will merge it into the auDeep repository. Your pull requests should contain a clear documentation of the changes and/or improvements you've made.

If you'd like to contribute, but are not sure where to start, you could also take a look at [issues marked with the "help wanted" label](https://github.com/auDeep/auDeep/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22). If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.

Finally, do not hesistate to contact us with any questions regarding contribution opportunities.

    ----------
    label_map: map of str to int
        The label map of a data set

    Balance classes in the specified partitions of the specified data set.
    
    If `partitions` is set, instances in the specified partitions are repeated so that each class has approximately the 
    same number of instances. Any partitions present in the data set, but not specified as parameters to this function 
    are left unchanged.
    
    If `partitions` is empty or None, the entire data set is upsampled.
    
    If an instance is upsampled, the string "upsampled.I", where I indicates the repetition index, is appended to the
    filename.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data_set: DataSet
        The data set in which classes should be balanced
    partitions: Partition or list of Partition
        The partitions in which classes should be balanced
